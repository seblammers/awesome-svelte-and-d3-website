	<h2>About this site</h2>
	<p>
		Interactive data visualization for the web is <strong>fascinating</strong>. But let's be honest,
		it's a challenging thing to learn, too.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>D3</strong> has been <strong>the gold standard</strong> library to create bespoke data
		visualizations for over 10 years. But it can be overwhelming.
		<strong>Svelte</strong> has changed the game with its <strong>beginner-friendly syntax</strong>
		and built-in convenience functions for e.g. visual transitions. Since a few years now, more and more
		dataviz-professionals pivot to a combination of <strong>Svelte & D3</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>This site</strong> aims to collect stunning examples of data-driven visuals that were
		created with this <strong>tool combination</strong>. The focus lies on the
		<strong>learning experience</strong>
		that comes from looking at other people's code. That's why only projects are showcased that also
		<strong>share their code publicly</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition, some great tutorials, both in written form and in video format, are collected on
		this site to help you start your <strong>Svelte & D3 learning journey</strong> or up your
		<strong>data visualization</strong> game.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
